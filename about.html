<br><font color="blue">Whether you want to exercise more, lose a few pounds, or keep fit, an electric scooter might be exactly what you need. In case you’re tired or don’t want to get sweaty, just twist and go.
 Some models can be configured as a mountain e-bike and used for traveling off road, which is a huge advantage.</br>
